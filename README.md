# Intelligent Home Portal Project Documentation

## Overview

This blog details my journey of transforming a 50mÂ² apartment into a smart home using Bone.IO, a Polish smart home system. It covers the features implemented, preparations for integrating smart home technologies, and insights gained throughout the process. The aim is to guide others on their smart home adventures, discussing various topics from interior design projects, electrical choices, to selecting controllers, designing modern interiors, IoT design, components used, and considerations for apartment design, including recommended materials and their summaries.

## Technologies Used

Since the project transitioned from Jekyll to Hugo, here's an updated list of technologies:
