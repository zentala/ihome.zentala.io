### About Hugo files structure

Here's a brief list of what each of these directories does in Hugo:

- `content`: Directory where website content is stored, such as articles, blog posts, static pages, etc.
- `static`: Directory where static files like images, CSS stylesheets, JavaScript scripts reside, which don't require processing by Hugo.
- `layouts`: Directory containing HTML templates that define how content stored in the `content` directory is displayed.
- `data`: Directory where data files reside, which can be used in templates, for example, JSON, YAML, or CSV files.
- `assets`: Directory that may contain source files such as Sass or TypeScript files, which are compiled into files in the `static` directory.
- `i18n`: Directory where translations of the website content for different languages are stored.
- `archetypes`: Directory containing templates of files used to generate new posts or pages with default data in the `content` directory.
