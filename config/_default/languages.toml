# TEMPORARY FIX: Define as "en" even though content is Polish
# This works around Hugo 0.150.1 multilingual bug
# Content remains Polish, Hugo treats it as "en" language
[en]
  languageName = "English"  # Changed from "Polish" but content IS Polish
  contentDir = "content"

    languageISO = "EN"  # Changed from "PL" for Hugo compatibility
    languageTag = "en-US"  # Changed from "pl-PL" for Hugo compatibility
    # footer is rendered in layouts/partials/footer/footer.html with dynamic year
