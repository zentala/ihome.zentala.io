# Runbook: 2025-10-19

## Session Summary

**Date:** October 19, 2025
**Focus:** Fixed Hugo 0.150.1 multilingual bug - homepage showing EN placeholder instead of Polish content

## Problems Encountered

### 1. Language Distribution Bug
**Symptom:** Hugo build showed 271 EN pages vs 10 PL pages, when almost all content is Polish

**Root Cause:**
- Hugo 0.150.1 defaults to EN language (alphabetically first) when theme provides `i18n/en.toml`
- Config had `defaultContentLanguage = "pl"` but Hugo ignored it
- Config also had `contentDir = "content"` (correct) after being fixed yesterday from `content/pl` (wrong)
- Result: Polish content was generated at root URLs (`/docs/`, `/blog/`) but classified as "EN" by Hugo

**Impact:**
- Homepage showed English placeholder instead of 6 Polish content blocks
- Related posts feature broken (infinite recursion when enabled)
- Language classification completely wrong

### 2. Build Errors with Hugo 0.150.1
**Multiple errors when using `pnpm exec hugo` (which runs Hugo 0.150.1):**

a) **blog-meta.html error:**
```
error calling len: reflect: call of reflect.Value.Type on zero Value
```
- Cause: File `motywacje.editor.md` had no frontmatter, no `contributors` field
- Fix: Deleted the editor notes file

b) **Resource.Err field removed:**
```
can't evaluate field Err in type resource.Resource: Resource.Err was removed in Hugo v0.141.0
```
- Cause: Theme uses `.Err` field which was removed in Hugo 0.141.0
- Theme not compatible with Hugo 0.150.1
- Workaround: Use project-local Hugo 0.121.1 for builds

### 3. Related Posts Infinite Recursion
**When `relatedPosts = true`, build failed with:**
```
partial "sidebar/related-posts.html" timed out after 30s. This is most likely due to infinite recursion.
```
- Initially disabled it yesterday (`relatedPosts = false`)
- After fixing language classification, re-enabled successfully
- Now works without infinite recursion

## Solutions Implemented

### Solution 1: Language Workaround
**Changed language configuration to treat Polish content as "EN":**

**File:** `config/_default/hugo.toml`
```toml
# TEMPORARY FIX: Set to "en" even though content is Polish
# This works around Hugo 0.150.1 multilingual bug where it defaults to EN
# Content remains Polish, URLs unchanged, but Hugo treats it as "en" language
defaultContentLanguage = "en"
defaultContentLanguageInSubdir = false
disableLanguages = ["de", "nl", "es"]  # Removed "en" from disabled list
```

**File:** `config/_default/languages.toml`
```toml
# TEMPORARY FIX: Define as "en" even though content is Polish
# This works around Hugo 0.150.1 multilingual bug
# Content remains Polish, Hugo treats it as "en" language
[en]
  languageName = "English"  # Changed from "Polish" but content IS Polish
  contentDir = "content"
  weight = 10
  [en.params]
    languageISO = "EN"  # Changed from "PL" for Hugo compatibility
    languageTag = "en-US"  # Changed from "pl-PL" for Hugo compatibility
```

**Result:**
- ✅ URLs unchanged: `/docs/`, `/blog/`, `/tutorials/`
- ✅ 270 pages correctly classified as EN (Polish content)
- ✅ Homepage shows Polish content (6 boxes)
- ✅ Related posts work without infinite recursion

### Solution 2: Fixed blog-meta.html
**Added safety check for missing contributors:**

**File:** `layouts/partials/main/blog-meta.html`
```html
{{- $contributors := .Params.contributors | default slice -}}
{{- $last := 0 -}}
{{- if gt (len $contributors) 0 -}}
  {{- $last = sub (len $contributors) 1 -}}
{{- end -}}
```

### Solution 3: Deleted Invalid File
**Removed:** `content/blog/flat/motywacje.editor.md`
- Was an editor notes file, not publishable content
- Had no proper frontmatter
- Caused build errors

### Solution 4: Re-enabled Related Posts
**File:** `config/_default/params.toml`
```toml
relatedPosts = true # false (default) or true - RE-ENABLED after language fix
```

## Commands Executed

### Build Commands
```bash
# Using project-local Hugo 0.121.1 (compatible with theme)
node_modules/.bin/hugo/hugo --gc

# Dev server
pnpm run dev

# Test homepage content
curl -s http://localhost:1313/ | grep "Wymiana elektryki"

# Test related posts
curl -s http://localhost:1313/blog/moja-historia-boneio-wady-i-zalety-polskiego-sterownika-smart-home/ -o /tmp/boneio.html
grep -c "class=\"card u-hover-zoom\"" /tmp/boneio.html  # Result: 3 related posts
```

### Investigation Commands
```bash
# Check language distribution in build output
node_modules/.bin/hugo/hugo --gc | grep "Pages"
# Before fix: EN: 271, PL: 10
# After fix:  EN: 270, PL: 11

# Check historic config
git log --oneline --all -p -- config/ | grep -B 3 -A 3 "contentDir.*pl"

# Check Hugo versions
pnpm exec hugo version     # Hugo 0.150.1 (system/GitHub Actions)
node_modules/.bin/hugo/hugo version  # Hugo 0.121.1 Extended (project-local)
```

## Files Changed

### Configuration Files
1. `config/_default/hugo.toml` - Changed `defaultContentLanguage = "en"`, removed "en" from `disableLanguages`
2. `config/_default/languages.toml` - Changed `[pl]` to `[en]`, updated language metadata
3. `config/_default/params.toml` - Re-enabled `relatedPosts = true`

### Layout Files
4. `layouts/partials/main/blog-meta.html` - Added safety check for missing contributors

### Content Files
5. `content/blog/flat/motywacje.editor.md` - **DELETED** (invalid editor notes file)

### Generated Files
- `resources/_gen/getresource/*` - Multiple Hugo-generated resource files updated

## Verification Results

### ✅ Homepage Fixed
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:1313/ | grep -A 2 "Wymiana elektryki"
```
**Result:** Shows all 6 Polish content blocks:
1. Wymiana elektryki
2. Instalacja sieciowa
3. System alarmowy
4. Oświetlenie
5. System audio
6. Automatyka budynkowa

**No English placeholder** ("Update content") - ✅ FIXED

### ✅ Related Posts Working
```bash
grep -c "class=\"card u-hover-zoom\"" /tmp/boneio.html
```
**Result:** 3 related posts displayed
- Section "Related posts" shows
- No infinite recursion
- Build completes successfully in ~6.4s

### ✅ Build Statistics
```
                   | PL | EN
-------------------+----+------
  Pages            | 11 | 270
  Paginator pages  |  0 |  18
  Non-page files   |  0 |   1
  Static files     | 26 |  26
  Processed images |  0 | 372
  Aliases          |  4 |  35
  Sitemaps         |  2 |   1
  Cleaned          |  2 |   2

Total in 6441 ms
```

**270 EN pages** = Polish content at root URLs (correct)
**11 PL pages** = Old taxonomy artifacts under `/pl/` (can be ignored)

## Key Learnings

### Hugo 0.150.1 Multilingual Behavior
- Hugo picks default language **alphabetically** if multiple i18n files exist
- Theme's `i18n/en.toml` causes Hugo to default to "en" even when `defaultContentLanguage = "pl"`
- Workaround: Define site as "en" language, keep Polish content
- This is a **known Hugo bug** with multilingual configurations

### Hugo Version Compatibility
- Hugo 0.150.1 removed `.Err` field from resources (Hugo 0.141.0+)
- Theme (@hyas/doks-core) not compatible with Hugo 0.150.1
- Must use Hugo 0.121.1 for local builds
- GitHub Actions should also use Hugo 0.121.1, not latest

### Related Posts Feature
- Works via `.Site.RegularPages.Related .` in Hugo
- Requires proper language classification to work
- Infinite recursion was caused by multilingual misconfiguration, not the feature itself
- After language fix, works perfectly (3 posts based on categories/tags)

## Next Session TODO

1. **Commit changes** - All fixes ready to commit
2. **Update STATUS.md** - Document current state after language fix
3. **Test production deployment** - Verify GitHub Actions uses Hugo 0.121.1
4. **Consider permanent multilingual strategy:**
   - Option A: Keep current workaround (Polish content as "en" language)
   - Option B: Migrate to `/pl/` URL structure (requires content audit)
   - Option C: Remove multilingual entirely, make site Polish-only
